What happens when one wants to slice an audio scene with various semantic concepts which could also be non-mutually exclusive for the constituent sources?

We will soon publish the data recipes for: 

- WSJ0-2mix (WSJ0): gender and energy (louder/softer) conditions.
- Spatial LibriSpeech (SLIB): spatial location of the speakers (near/far field), gender, and energy conditions.
- Spatial VoxForge (SVOX): language of the speaker (German/English/French/Spanish), spatial location of the speakers, energy conditions.
